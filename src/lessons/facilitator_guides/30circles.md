# 30 Circles

[Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2013/11/three-creativity-challenges-from-ideos-leaders) covered this exercise.

The goal is to encourage creativity and promote quick thinking. We did it in Week 1, because it is also a fun icebreaker!

1. Give each participant a piece of paper with 30 circles on it.
2. Give the participants 3 minutes to turn as many of the 30 circles as possible into objects. Each drawing needs to be unique.
3. Review everyone's drawings and look for commonalities and differences.
