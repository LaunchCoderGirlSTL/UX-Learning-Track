# Interview Activity

This activity is to reinforce that when interviewing users, we want to make sure to ask open-ended questions. Open-ended questions provoke discussion, conversation and cannot be answered with a yes or no answer.

We will use the following questions in class:

1. How did you and your best friend meet?
2. What is your favorite place to visit?
3. Which pair of shows do you like the most?
4. What is one of your 2018 goals?
5. Who is your icon?
6. In what way does your icon inspire you?
7. Who is your favorite female musician?
8. What is your favorite song to dance to?
9. What is your favorite inspirational quote?
10. What is the most difficult dish for you to cook?
